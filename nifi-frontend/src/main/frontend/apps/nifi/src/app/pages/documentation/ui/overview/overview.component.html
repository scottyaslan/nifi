            Apache NiFi is a dataflow system based on the concepts of flow-based programming. It supports powerful and
            scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. NiFi has a web-based
            user interface for design, control, feedback, and monitoring of dataflows. It is highly configurable along
            several dimensions of quality of service, such as loss-tolerant versus guaranteed delivery, low latency
            versus high throughput, and priority-based queuing. NiFi provides fine-grained data provenance for all data
            received, forked, joined cloned, modified, sent, and ultimately dropped upon reaching its configured
            end-state.
