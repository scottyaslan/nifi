# HandleHttpRequest

## Usage Description

The pairing of this Processor with
a [HandleHttpResponse](../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.HandleHttpResponse/index.html) Processor provides the
ability to use NiFi to visually construct a web server that can carry out any functionality that is available through
the existing Processors. For example, one could construct a Web-based front end to an SFTP Server by constructing a flow
such as:

[HandleHttpRequest](index.html) -> [PutSFTP](../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.PutSFTP/index.html) -> [HandleHttpResponse](../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.HandleHttpResponse/index.html)

The HandleHttpRequest Processor provides several Properties to configure which methods are supported, the paths that are
supported, and SSL configuration.

To handle requests with Content-Type: _multipart/form-data_ containing multiple parts, additional attention needs to be
paid. Each _part_ generates a FlowFile of its own. To each these FlowFiles, some special attributes are written:

* http.context.identifier
* http.multipart.fragments.sequence.number
* http.multipart.fragments.total.number

These attributes could be used to implement a gating mechanism for HandleHttpResponse processor to wait for the
processing of FlowFiles with sequence number **http.multipart.fragments.sequence.number** until up to *
*http.multipart.fragments.total.number** of flow files are processed, belonging to the same **http.context.identifier**,
which is unique to the request.
